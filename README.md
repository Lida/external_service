# ExternalService

An Elixir library for safely using external services using customizable retry
logic and the circuit breaker pattern.

## Documentation

See [my blog post](https://ropig.com/blog/use-external-services-safely-reliably-elixir-applications/) for overview documentation, and then check out the [API reference](https://hexdocs.pm/external_service/api-reference.html) for full details.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `external_service` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:external_service, "~> 0.7.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/external_service](https://hexdocs.pm/external_service).
